# Chirp-a-Laravel-bootcamp-project
Chirp is a Laravel bootcamp project I’ve been working on to solidify my understanding of the framework. It’s a practical application where I’ve implemented features like routing, controllers, models, and database management.

I’m also integrating frontend tools like Inertia.js and Vue.js to create a full-stack experience.  Through Chirp, I’m practicing CRUD operations, user authentication, and exploring API interactions.
